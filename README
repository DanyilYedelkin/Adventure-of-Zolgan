# Adventure of Zolgan
The game "Adventure of Zolgan" is writed by using Unity and C# language. It's only a demo game (in process), with demo sprites, etc.
# DEMO HISTORY
The thesis's topic is RPG game in Unity with emphasis on its artificial intelligence elements. Consequently, I decided to create the 2D RPG game Adventure of Zolgan with its own elaborate world and story. 

In the universe of Arax there are many worlds, ranging from the world of angels and gods to the world of worms. One day in the world of Urrok, the great necromancer Erebor was born. All his life he had studied black magic and the time came when he wanted to get close to the gods and subdue them. Gathering most of the inhabitants of his planet, he performed a dark sacrament, killing them all in the process. The sacrifices that were made helped Erebor become so great that he could now kill any god. But all these manipulations were not without side-effects. All those who have been sacrificed have turned into the undead, who stagger around the world seeking revenge on their murderer and all the living for their suffering. 

The gods of the Galduino world did not like the actions of the great necromancer, for it could have shaken their majesty and power in the universe. So they sent one of the archangels who guarded the gates to the divine world - he was our protagonist Zolgan. Zolgan's main task will be to destroy all the evil in the world and decapitate Erebor - the game's main boss.
